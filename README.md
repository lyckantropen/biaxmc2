# biaxmc2

This is the code that was used for obtaining results for my PhD
dissertation, ["Lattice Models of Biaxial, Tetrahedratic and Chiral
Order"](https://fais.uj.edu.pl/documents/41628/d13cf0c3-7942-425c-9ab4-26fecb7cb518).
This code is old, a newer version is being developed
[here](https://github.com/lyckantropen/latticemc).
